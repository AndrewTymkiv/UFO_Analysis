## Results


As seen in the image of the webpage, below a few brief introductory paragraphs, there is a table of recorded UFO sightings in the United States, displaying multiple pieces of information about each encounter including the date of the sighting, the locations, the shape of the unidentified object, the duration of the sighting, and then any additional comments.

On the left side of the webpage, one can condense and specify their search by using the various filter boxes. The webpage allows the user to filter their search by the following:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Summary
Although the webpage provides a great method of researching UFO sightings, it does not have the ability to add live data immediately. The data.js file would need to be updated manually for any new sightings to be recorded on the webpage. Adding this function would greatly enhance the webpage and ensure it doesn't become outdated with old data. 

Furthermore, the data provided for the webpage only includes UFO sightings in the US, despite there being a filter for country. Adding recorded sightings from other countries around the world would likely make the webpage more appealing to other users around the world.
